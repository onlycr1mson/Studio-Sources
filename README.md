I send useless files here for other dev's to try.

You can use and look at these files for yourself or your own projects.
But you can’t copy, share, repost, or give them to others — changed or not — unless I say it’s okay.

All rights are mine.

These files come “as is.” I don’t promise they work or are safe.
If you use them and something goes wrong, that’s on you, not me.

I don’t put out Roblox games or models very often.
If you want new stuff, check back later or follow me for updates.
Thanks for understanding.
